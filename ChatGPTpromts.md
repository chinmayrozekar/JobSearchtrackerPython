# ChatGPT Prompt History for Job Application Tracker Development

## Initial Request
I want to write a python program to track all the jobs I am applying in my job search.
The program should have a gui and ask me if i have applied for jobs today?
The program should also have a counter that tracks how many jobs i have applied today, say my target is to apply for 50 jobs today.

## GUI Modification
The program should also record the jobs i have applied based on each company I apply to.

## Further Enhancements
The GUI should also allow me to record the link for the job application.

## GUI Adjustment
Make the size of the gui a bit bigger.
When I click on the Yes button, it opens another gui, I don't want that. Please make it all in one GUI.
When I click the Submit button, I don't want an additional confirmation window.
When I click on "Show Applied Jobs," it should generate a CSV and show me that CSV file so that I can keep track of things.

## CSV Generation Update
I want the CSV to be generated on the following conditions:
1. I click Submit.
2. I close the GUI.

## CSV File Persistence
In NO WAY should the prior information in the CSV file be deleted when the program is restarted.

## Include Today's Date in CSV
The final CSV should also show me today's date for each entry.

## Job Application Tracker Completion
Alright, good job. I like it.
